      If you can't see experiments you expect to be there, this is probably because they are associated with an older version of a listed model or protocol.

      An 'inapplicable' experiment is one where the model does not contain some biological feature probed by the protocol.
      Experiments show as red if no graphs are available, green if all those expected from the protocol description are generated.
      Note that no comparison is done against experimental data, and so the colours do <strong>not</strong> indicate model 'correctness' in any sense.
