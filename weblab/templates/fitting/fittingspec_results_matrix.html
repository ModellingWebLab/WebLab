      This matrix shows the latest versions (visible to you) of the models and dataset in our database, with the corresponding experiments.
      {% if perms.create_experiment %}
        If you can't see experiments you expect to be there, this is probably because they are associated with an older version of a listed model or protocol.
        You can click on the white squares to launch experiments using the latest versions.

      <p>
      Note that you can compare models' behaviours under a particular protocol by viewing the protocol (click on a column heading), selecting the 'Compare models' button, and comparing the experiments using models of interest.
      The converse comparison (one model, many protocols) is available via viewing a model.
      </p>
      <p>
      Alternatively, enable 'comparison mode' to allow selecting arbitrary experiments from this matrix view to compare.
      Click on a column or row heading to select the entire column or row.<br/>

      An 'inapplicable' experiment is one where the model does not contain some biological feature probed by the protocol.
      Experiments show as red if no graphs are available, green if all those expected from the protocol description are generated.
      Note that no comparison is done against experimental data, and so the colours do <strong>not</strong> indicate model 'correctness' in any sense.
