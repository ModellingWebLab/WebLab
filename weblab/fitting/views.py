"""
Views for fitting specifications and results.

As far as possible these reuse code & templates from entities and experiments.

At present I'm not sure what the best way to do this is. Many of the forms & views will
be the same, but some will differ, and sometimes quite a long way in. So we may need to
create separate versions of everything (but reuse code & templates where possible). Or
we may be able to extend the base classes to be able to delegate to elsewhere, for instance
by removing the hardcoded 'entities:' namespace from reverse() calls.
